## Briefly About Myself
<br/>

I study the layout and am interested in the frontend. Good skills in using HTML and CSS. General knowledge of JavaScript, Java Core. A general representation of manual QA testing.
I found and studied all the acquired knowledge from open sources.
When I found out about the RSSchool courses, I decided to take it and get enough knowledge to acquire a new specialty in the field of JS developer.


In March 2023, I completed the preparatory course JS/FE PreSchool 2022Q4 on the portal [https://app.rs.school]. At the end of the course, I have a landing page project and a desktop application, such as [https://momentumdash.com].<br/>
During this course I acquired the following skills:
* The layout of the site is made on the principle of Perfect Pixel.
* Adaptive design has been applied to the site. In the process, I learned how to position elements using Flex and Grid.
* In the project, I used pseudo-elements and CSS variables, performed responsive design using media queries.
* I expanded the functionality on the site using scripts in the JS programming language.
* When executing the momentum application, the code was structured by modules. To work with the DOM object, I used asynchronous functions. The DOM elements were accessed via the querySelector method.

The following widgets have been developed in the application:
* Welcome Widget
* Date and current time widget
* Widget for loading a random background image according to the time of day
* Widget for downloading a random quote of the day, which it receives from a JSON file
* Audio player widget. Has been developed: play/pause track, track listening progress bar, volume control, access to the track list is via JSON.
* Weather widget. Weather information is obtained through the site's API https://home.openweathermap.org/
* In the application settings menu, you can remove or add the necessary widget to the screen
* User data is stored in Local storage.

Links to a brief description of the projects are located in the Completed courses section of my CV.

      return (n+i)
    }else
